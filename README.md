# HAIRDRESSING SALON

## Description

The website design of the hairdressing salon was created to practice html and ccs. It has almost no logic (this may change soon). The responsiveness of the website has been achieved mainly with the help of a grid and media query.

In the hairdressing-salon app you can make an appointment at the salon by pressing the "MAKE AN APPOINTMENT" button. After completing the form and providing the required data, you can book an appointment using the "BOOK" button.

In the "OFFER" section, the current offer of the salon with prices is available. In the "TEAM" tab you can see our team - director, instructors and stylists. All of them are qualified to practice their profession.

If you have any additional questions, you can ask them in the "CONTACT" tab. Just fill in the form - enter your name, e-mail address and the content of the message and press the "SEND A MESSAGE" button. We will try to answer as soon as possible.
